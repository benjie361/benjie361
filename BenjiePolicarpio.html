      My name is Benjie Castro Policarpio, a first-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at the College For Research and Technology (CRT). I am also a working student, which teaches me how to manage my time wisely between my responsibilities at work and my studies. Life hasn't been easy for me--I no longer have my parents--but I continue to push forward with determination and strength. Despite the challenges, I stay focused on my dreams and work hard to build a better future. I believe that through hard work, dedication, and faith, I can overcome any obstacle and achieve success in both my personal and professional life.

      My 3 Best Photo
     </h2>
     <p class="mb-4">
      These 3 photos are more than just snapshots--they're moments that mark a special chapter in my life: my birthday, and the beginning of my modeling era.

The shoot wasn't just for celebration--it was about claiming space, embracing growth, and expressing myself fully through style, pose, and presence. Every outfit, every angle, every click told a different story of who I am and who I'm becoming.

The first photo has a clean, studio look. The bold black-and-white stripes and plaid mix represent contrast--just like how I balance simplicity and boldness in my personality. Calm, composed, yet daring to stand out.

The second photo shifts the vibe. It's darker, fiercer, more dramatic. With the chain in hand and shadows on my face, this photo symbolizes power and resilience. It's me showing a deeper, stronger side--unapologetic and unshaken.

And the third photo brings the celebration full circle. Holding my cake while rocking those shades, this picture gives cool, confident energy. It's playful but still stylish. It captures the joy of the moment and the pride in how far I've come.

This shoot marked the start of something I now call my 'modeling era'--a time where I let myself be seen, not just for how I look but for what I represent: confidence, creativity, and realness. I may not have years of experience, but I have passion, vision, and the drive to grow.

This is my reminder--to myself and to others--that it's okay to be bold. It's okay to step into new spaces. And it's okay to celebrate yourself in your own way.

My name, my era, my moment. And this… is just the beginning."
